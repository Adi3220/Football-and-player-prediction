# Football and Player Prediction

This project aims to predict football game outcomes and player performance using machine learning and deep learning techniques.



## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- **Computer Vision Libraries:** OpenCV, YOLOv8
- **Data Processing Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization Libraries:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Other Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Football-and-Player-prediction-main.git
    cd Football-and-Player-prediction-main
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r CODE/requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:

    ```bash
    python CODE/prepare_data.py
    ```

2. Create annotations for the dataset:

    ```bash
    python CODE/create_annotations.py
    ```

3. Download the necessary weights for the model:

    ```bash
    bash CODE/download_weights.sh
    ```

4. Train the model using YOLOv5:

    Open `CODE/YOLOv5.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions to train the model.

### Testing

Use the test images and videos provided in the `TEST/` and `vids/` directories to evaluate the model performance.
